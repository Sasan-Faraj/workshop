# Response to Jahan and Rosling

## Question: What are some of the targetted issues that Jahan examples as requiring focus throughout the world? Elaborate further on Jahan’s definition of human development. What are the different measures incorporated into the Human Development Index that serve to capture the breadth and focus of each countries’ average achievement?

### Answer: 

When Jahan discusses focus throughout the world, he mainly talks about living a long, health life, having knowledge, and having some sort of basic standard of life, and the discussion surrounding focus plays a significant role into his definition into human development. First, he says that human development is about human capabilities advancing, but in order to utilize that development, opportunities need to be created in order to maximize those capabilities. For instance, Jahan speaks about increasing the amount of creative jobs (i.e. artisitic, volunteer, or car work), because those opportunities will help humans become more interconnected. Jahan breaks the Human Development Index into breadth and focus, suggesting the breadth is like a house (macro-level) and the focus is like the door (micro-level). From the breadth measure, we can get to know the world from multiple perspectives to see the quality of life. From a focus measure, we can see how humans live a long, happy life with basic knowledge.

## Question: What were some of the examples Rosling presented where health appeared to be a precursor to wealth? What was Rosling’s warning regarding the dangers of using averages when describing development?

## Answer:

Towards the beginning of his talk, Rosling demenostrates that lower income countries in east Asia generally had shorter life spans, indicating low levels of health. By the end of his talk, he brings attention to how many east Asian countries (i.e. China, Vietnam, and South Korea) have revitalized with a growing economy, correlating this to their longer life spans. So Rosling insinuates that having healthier lives allowed people to be more engaged citizens, thus revitilizing the economy. Rosling's warning regarding the dangers of using averages relates to  how quickly data change and how vastly different situations in countries are. If these things are prominent, then averages are misleading.
