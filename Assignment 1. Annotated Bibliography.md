1.  Utazi, C.D., Thorley, J., Alegana, V. A., Ferrari, M.J., Takahashi, S., Metcalf, C. J. E., Lessler, J., & Tatem, A.J. (2018). High resolution age-structured mapping of childhood vaccination coverage in low and middle income countries.*Vaccine, 36*(12), 1583-1591. h[ttps://doi.org/ 10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.02.020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.02.020)	

   

​     Utazi and the rest of the authors attempted to answer the general question of what was the vaccination coverage in Nigeria, Mozambique, and Cambodia and how could they produce the the highest resolution analysis. In order to do this, they attained survey data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) which produce cluster-level data. Incorporating a Bayesian hierarchical model through Markov Chain Monte Carlo methodology, they created a 1 x 1km resolution map, displaying the vaccination coverage of children under the age of five, separating the age group into different categories/levels. 

​	Utazi and the other authors specifically state that this form of a study is necessary so countries or organizations can help meet the sustainable development goals of the United Nations. Specifically, this article relates the most to the third SDG which is to ensure and promote healthy lives to people of all ages, though this study solely examines people under the age of 5. The harm that this article is trying to address is that lower- and middle-income countries generally have vaccination rates that are lower than what the United Nations desire, which is 90% vaccination coverage. So the researchers wanted to see if that was true and where the improvement needed to be. This topic can be difficult to analyze. For starters, there are many different diseases that children should be vaccinated for; however, the researchers decided to focus on the vaccination rates of Measles. Another inherent issue, which was directly written by the authors, is the way that DHS collects its data. In order to protect the random ability and privacy of its users, DHS uses cluster-level data, so the researchers needed to create a methodology in order to accurately determine where the clusters are, so they can have geographically correct data. If the researchers want to display where governments and organizations need to vaccinate, they must know the specific locations of where to go.	

​      In relation to human development, health care, in many ways, dictates whether or not humans live. So by the inherent nature of the vaccine being able to save hundreds to thousands of lives, finding out where the vaccinations are needed the most can help increase human development by increasing the number of humans alive. This closely relates to Sen’s claims on human development, because he argues that human development relies on human capabilities. Being alive is the essence of human capability. If they are not alive, they cannot be capable of anything. The human development pattern/process that the researchers are looking at is how vaccination rates impact the quality of life of people. Though they do not explicitly state that is what they are looking at, by researching this topic and providing a map displaying vaccination rates, they are feeding into the overall discussion of vaccination rates and quality of life, because sickness dictates quality of life.
