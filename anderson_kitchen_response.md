# Anderson and Kitchen Response

With the availability of big data, Anderson argues that scientific theory is dead and no longer needed. In response to this, Kitchen writes about three different view points surrounding this topic. Taking these two sources into consideration, I believe that when producing studies using big data, the portion of the scientific method that requires retrials have become obsolete. For instance, in a regular expirement, you would conduct it several times for verification. However with big dat, you already have the possible out comes. 

Though this is a nice characteristic of big data, this does not free big data of the scientific method. This is because, as Kitchen states, the algorithims conducting the analysis of big data are based in theories made from the scientific method. So though the use of big data to find an answer does not need multiple trials, the algorithms that make up these analysis do.
